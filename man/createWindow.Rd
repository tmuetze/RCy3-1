\description{
Request that Cytoscape create a new window for the supplied
CytoscapeWindowClass object.  It will hold a new network, using
the title supplied when the object's constructor was called.

This method will probably not often be useful: it is called behind the
scenes by the CytoscapeWindow constructor unless you specify (in calling
the constructor) 'create.window=FALSE'.   In that case, or if you
interactively delete the window in Cytoscape, or if you call the
'deleteWindow' or 'deleteAllWindows' methods, you can create a new
window by calling this method.
}
\usage{
createWindow(obj)
}
\arguments{
  \item{obj}{a \code{CytoscapeWindowClass} object. }
}

\value{
Nothing.
