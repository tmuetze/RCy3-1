RCy3 README
-----------------
Unit tests are a crucial tool in software development.
In order to run them 'offline' (not on the Bioconductor build system),
take these steps from within a running R session:

  1) source(system.file("unitTests", "test_RCy3.R", package="RCy3"))
  2) run.tests ()

They take about 20 minutes to run.
